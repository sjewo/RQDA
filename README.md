## How to change the font sizes of RQDA interfacea

2. This can be achived by modifying ~/gtkrc-2.0 (create on if not exists), for instance:

```
style "user-font" {
    font_name = "Lucida Grande 14"
}
widget_class "*" style "user-font"

gtk-font-name="Lucida Grande 14"
gtk-enable-mnemonics = 0
```
